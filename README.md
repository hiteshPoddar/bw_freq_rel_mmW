# Power_Freq_relations_mmW
Matlab code having relationship between rcvd power and freq at different carrier frequencies for a given BW.
the BW is usually ~ center_freq/10.
Ex: at 100 GHz we usually have bandwidth as <= 10GHz.

A plot is obtained which shows the SNR obtained for a given BW at different carrier frequencies.
Ex: Center Frequency = 100 GHz, Bandwidths considered at 100 GHz are 100 MHz, 500 MHz, etc and then for each of these BW the SNR obtained
is computed.
